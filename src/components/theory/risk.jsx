        <MDBTypography variant='p'>A common problem in risk identification is that a list of risks is potentially endless.</MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'>Estimating the risk exposure for each risk using the formula:</MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'>Risk Exposure = (Potential Damage) * (Probability of Occurence) </MDBTypography>
        
        <MDBTypography variant='p'>The risk reduction action can be assessed by calculating the “Risk Reduction Leverage”(RRL)</MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'>RRL = (RE<sub>before</sub> - RE<sub>after</sub>) / Cost of risk reduction </MDBTypography>

        <MDBTypography variant='h4'>Earned Value Management</MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'><strong>Earned Value (EV)</strong>The Totoal value credited to a project at any point is known as the 'earned value'</MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'><strong>Baseline Budget (PV)</strong> Setting up the earned value analysis is to create the baseline budget </MDBTypography>
        <MDBTypography variant='p'><strong>Actual Cost (AC)</strong> By recording the “Earned Value”, the actual cost of each task can be collected as “Actual Cost” or ACWP-Actual Cost of Work Performed. </MDBTypography>

        <MDBTypography variant='h4'>Types of Varience</MDBTypography>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Schedule Varience (SV) </strong>The Schedule Varience is measured in cost terms as </li>
          <p>SV = EV - PV</p>
          
          <li><strong>Time Varience (TV) </strong>Difference between the time when the achievement of the current earned value was planned to occur and the time now.</li>
          <p>SV = PT - AT</p>

          <li><strong>Cost Varience (CV) </strong> It indicates the difference between the earned value or budgeted cost and the actual cost of the completed work </li>
          <p>CV = EV - AC</p>
        </ol>

        <MDBTypography variant='h4'>Performance Ratios</MDBTypography>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Schedule Performance Indes (SPI) </strong>The Schedule Varience is measured in cost terms as </li>
          <p>SV = EV / PV</p>

          <li><strong>Cost Performance Index (CPI) </strong> It indicates the difference between the earned value or budgeted cost and the actual cost of the completed work </li>
